Standard Classes
================

Along side the [API](api.html), Pinq comes the set of standard implementations for each of
the interfaces. If you need to add and custom functionality to the Pinq API, you should extend
these classes as they contain the [correct and tested implementation](details.html) for the 
standard API.

The following classes are provided:

 - `Traversable implements ITraversable`

 - `Collection implements ICollection`

 - `Queryable implements IQueryable`

 - `Repository implements IRepository`
